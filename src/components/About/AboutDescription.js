        Hello! My name is Piotrek. I am 28 years old Front-End Developer. For
        last more than a three years, I was working as a Senior Client Service
        Specialist at State Street company and in addition for the last year I
        was gaining an experience as a freelance web developer. One and a half
        year ago I decided, that I want to change something in my life and
        started learning front-end. After a few months I created a few first,
        simple applications and I knew, that this is something I would like to
        do for a living in the future. From that time, I am still learning new
        technologies and creating next and more advanced applications, also
        commercial ones.
