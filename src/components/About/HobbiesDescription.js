        My biggest passion is sport - I have been playing volleyball for about
        13 years. Last season I was playing with my team in 2nd polish league.
        In addition, I work on a gym, ride a bike and hike in the mountains. My
        second passion is traveling. Exploring new places and meeting new
        cultures is for me something special, that gives opportunity to broad
        horizons.
